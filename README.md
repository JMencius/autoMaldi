# autoMaldi

Typically, if you want to analysis a maldi TOF file (Fig. 1). Maybe most people will use ruler (measure the length) and calculator (Calculate the ratio). Maybe half a minute is required to process per figure

But with the help of Python programming, you can do the same thing in less than 5 seconds.

More intriguingly, you can even process multiple files in less than 5 seconds. Even 1000 maldi TOF files can be processed in a blink of an eye.

It is absolute accurate and timesaving compared to tedious and error-prone manual calculating.
